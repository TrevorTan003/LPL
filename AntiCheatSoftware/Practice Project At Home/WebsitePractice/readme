Practice on the web app using ASP.NET Core (MVC):
Things I did:
     • Connected to database
     • Added Identity (Login and Register) by adding scaffolded items
     • Roles (Created Roles and can edit the roles but still need to add the delete feature)
     • Bad html
     
I still need to add authorization so that the role management controller and views are not accessible to other roles (i.e [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")])
so only users with the "Admin" role can access them and more.
